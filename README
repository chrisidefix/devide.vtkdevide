Current ITK/VTK notes
---------------------

*****
As of 20031201: Rude bug with CVS ITK, VTK and DICOMParser.  Both ITK and VTK
use the same DICOMParser and it seems that the wrong code is being executed
at dynamic linking due to symbols being identical.  See my posting:
http://www.itk.org/pipermail/insight-users/2003-December/005716.html

Temporary fix: comment out DICOM thingies in RegisterBuiltInFactories() in
Code/IO/itkImageIOFactory.cxx

Getting this to build in Visual C++ 6.0
---------------------------------------

General
-------

- If you're going to build a Debug release, you'll notice a missing
  python22_d.lib.  To workaround this if you don't really need debugging in
  the python library, edit pyconfig.h: change the ref to python22_d.lib to
  just python22.lib and comment out #define Py_DEBUG

Your VTK build
--------------

- You're going to build with Python wrapping, so you need Tcl installed.  
  Makes sense, doesn't it?  Because Python 2.2.3 itself makes use of tcl/tk
  8.3, I installed ActiveTcl 8.3.5.0-2 (from activestate.com); most of the tk 
  thingies required by cmake are in f:\tcl\include and lib.  TK_INTERNAL_PATH
  is of course in the VTK/Rendering/tkInternals/tk<version>.

- Python 2.3.3 uses Tcl 8.4, so... (ActiveTcl8.4.6.1-win32-ix86-99631.exe)

- VERY important: make sure that VTK_USE_ANSI_STDLIB is set to ON in your
  VTK cmake configuration!


The vtkdscas config
-------------------

- Also modify the dcmtk project in MSVC++ to use /MD and not /MT.  You only
  have to build ofstd and dcmdata

- Since VTK has started mangling zlib names in their zlib library (better this
  way), you must build dcmdata with the VTK zlib library: modify the "project|
  settings| c/c++" in VC and add VTKSourceDir/Utilities/vtkzlib and
  VTKBuildDir/Utilities to the includes.  Make sure there's no other zlib
  include/library directories lying around on the same level as the dcmtk
  root.  This way, DCMTK will make use of
  vtk's zlib version.
