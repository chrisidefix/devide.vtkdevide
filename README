Getting this to build in Visual C++ 6.0
---------------------------------------
- VERY important: make sure that VTK_USE_ANSI_STDLIB is set to ON in your
  VTK cmake configuration!

- Add ws2_32.lib and netapi32.lib to the standard libraries
  (CMAKE_STANDARD_LIBRARIES).  Both HDF and DCMTK require this.

- Use the dlllib subdirectory of the HDF installation: VTK and also vtkdscas
  are compiled with /MD (multi-threaded and DLL support)

- Also modify the dcmtk project in MSVC++ to use /MD and not /MT.  You only
  have to build ofstd and dcmdata
